        <h3 id="about">Why?</h3>    
            <p>The photo above shows the disembodied head and salivary glands of a mosquito. The translucent sacs host the malaria parasite, making them crucial for malaria research and vaccine production. </p>
            <p>The process of salivary gland extraction is extremely labor intensive, acting as a massive bottleneck to research. Members of the Kaushansky lab at the Center for Infectious Disease Research spend most of their Thursdays staring into microscopes, pulling apart mosquito after mosquito for hours on end.  </p>
            <p>Salivary gland extraction also requires skill and weeks, if not months, of training. The picture above shows my first “perfect” manual dissection where all six glands (two pairs of three) were extracted intact. This occurred after nearly three months of dissecting mosquitoes. The dissection took me a couple minutes, but thousands of salivary glands can be needed for an experiment.</p>
            <p>I was brought into the lab along with two other students to create a system to automate the process and alleviate the burden of mosquito salivary gland extraction. </p>
        <h3 id="about">About the Project</h3>
            <p>I’m not able to say much about the system and devices we developed, but I’ll describe a bit about my experience working in the lab.</p>
            <p>I greatly enjoyed the freedom of the project. It was up to our team of three students to determine the direction of the project, the tasks to accomplish, and the allocation of our budget. Developing a novel technology with a small group allowed me to hone my ability to manage a project and work with a team. The project was a bit slow at the start, but soon enough we had hit our stride and made quick progress.</p>
            <p>Every week, we held a presentation which showcased our progress to supervisors and other experts in the field of infectious disease research. These meetings were technically focused and allowed us to receive feedback and suggestions. Additionally, we held non-technical presentations to company executives where we explained the impact of our system and made our case for the support of our devices into the patenting process. </p>
            <p>I was surrounded by knowledgeable people from a completely different field, so I’m happy to have worked and learned in an untraditional mechanical engineering internship position. I already miss the smell of the insectary. </p>
